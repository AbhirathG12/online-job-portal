Actually what happened is we were not able to upload node_modules the limit is 100 files and 25 mb at a time so directly only backend.zip and frontend.zip


create a folder Placement portal
In that folder unzip backend and front end separately
after that in command prompt navigate to this backend folder and before running just type is command
"npm install --save"
"npm start"

Repeat the same thing for front end also.

in another command prompt run "mongod" which will start mongodb
